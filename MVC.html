        <h1>Advantages of MVC</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - ASP.NET MVC framework doesn’t use View State and thus reduces the bandwidth of the requests to an extent.
            <br />
            - The MVC framework provides a clean separation of the UI, Business Logic, Model or Data.

            A route is a URL pattern.
            <br />
            a) Convention-based routing - to define this type of routing, we call MapRoute method and set its unique name, URL pattern and specify some default values.
            <br />
            b) Attribute-based routing - to define this type of routing, we specify the Route attribute in the action method of the controller

            - Type is object
            <br />
