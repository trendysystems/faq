        <h1>What is CLR?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            CLR stands for common language run-time.

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is a Class?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            A class is a blueprint of an object.
            <br />
            A class has fields, properties, methods.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is an Object?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            An object is an instance of a class through which we access the methods, fields, properties of that class. “New” keyword is used to create an object.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Encapsulation?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Hiding the members from outside of class by using Access modifiers.

        <h1>static</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - static keyword can be used in properties/fields/methods to access them without creating object. (<<ClassName.Property /Field/Method>
                >
                <br />
                - static keyword also can be used in static class for extension methods.

    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>extension method?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - Extension methods enable you to add methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
            <br />
            - An extension method is a static method of a static class, where the "this" modifier is applied to the first parameter. The type of the first parameter will be the type that is extended.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Constructor?</h1>
        <div class="ans">

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>default constructor?</h1>

        <h1>constant vs readonly</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            constant:
            <br />
            - It's mandatory to assign a value to constant variables
            <br />
            - Value is constant at compile time.
            <br />
            - We cannot change the value of a const variable throughout the entire program.
            <br />
            readonly:
            <br />
            - We can change during runtime or we can assign it at run time but only through the non-static constructor.

        <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
        <div class="ans">

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is the difference between Interface and Abstract Class in C#</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - An abstract class can have non-abstract methods (concrete methods) while in case of interface, all the methods have to be abstract.
            <br />
            - An abstract class can declare or use any variables while an interface is not allowed to do so.
            <br />
            - In an abstract class, all data members or functions are private by default while in an interface all are public, we can’t change them manually.

        <h1>What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Class and struct are both user-defined data types
            <br />
            Struct:
            <br />
            - The struct is a value type
            <br />
            - Struct can’t be inherited from other types

            Once a class is defined as a sealed class, that class cannot be inherited.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>partial classes</h1>
        <div class="ans">

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is a Virtual Method in C#</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - A virtual method is created in the base class that can be overridden in the derived class.
            <br />
            - It is used when a method's basic functionality is the same but sometimes more functionality is needed in the derived class.
        </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What are the differences between IEnumerable and IQueryable</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            IEnumerable:
            <br />
            - It is the parent interface for all non-generic collections
            <br />
            - It is used for query the data from in-memory collections like List, Array etc.
            <br />
            IQueryable:
            <br />
            - It is used for query the data from database, suitable for linq to sql.
            <br />
            - Supports lazy loading so we can use in paging kind of scenarios
        </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>throw vs throw exception</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Throw basically retains the stack trace.

            String:
            <br />
            - Immutable object
            <br />
            - Performance-wise, string is slow because it creates a new instance to override or change the previous value
            <br />
            StringBuilder:
            <br />
            - Mutable object
            <br />
            - Performance-wise StringBuilder is very fast because it will use the same instance of StringBuilder object to perform any operation like inserting a value in the existing string

    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Pass by Reference</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - The ref/out keyword indicates a value that is passed by reference
            <br />
            - When we pass parameters by reference the value of the parameter is changed, then the actual value stored at the memory location gets changed as no copy is getting created for the value passed as parameter.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Array vs ArrayList</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Array:
            <br />
            - Array is strongly typed. This means that an array can have items of the same type only.
            <br />
            - The size of the array is fixed.
            <br />

        <div class="ans">
            Parameters are optional when a default value is specified to a particular argument.
            <br />
            If we do not pass any parameter to the optional arguments, then it takes its default value.
            <br />
            The default value of an optional parameter is a constant expression.
            <br />
            The optional parameters are always defined at the end of the parameter list.
