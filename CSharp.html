        <h1>What is the .Net framework?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - The .NET framework supports an object-oriented approach that is used for building applications on windows.
	        - It supports various languages like C#, VB.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is an assembly?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            An assembly is a file that is automatically generated by the compiler.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is a garbage collector?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Garbage collector frees the unused code objects in the memory.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is CLR?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            CLR stands for common language run-time.
            <br>
	        CLR manages the execution of programs written in any language (C#, VB.Net, F#) that uses the .NET Framework.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is a Class?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            A class is a blueprint of an object.
            <br>
	        A class has fields, properties, methods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>What is an Object?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            An object is an instance of a class through which we access the methods, fields, properties of that class. “New” keyword is used to create an object.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Encapsulation?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Hiding the members from outside of class by using Access modifiers.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Access Specifier/Modifiers</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Public

    <div class="ques">
        <h1>static</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - static keyword can be used in properties/fields/methods to access them without creating object. (<<ClassName.Property/Field/Method>>
            <br>
            - static keyword also can be used in static class for extension methods.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>extension method?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - Extension methods enable you to add methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
            <br>
            - An extension method is a static method of a static class, where the "this" modifier is applied to the first parameter. The type of the first parameter will be the type that is extended.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Constructor?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            A constructor is used to initialize the instance variables. Constructor name must be same as class name and it does not have a return type.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>default constructor?</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            A default constructor is one without parameters
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>constant vs readonly</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            constant:
            <br>
            - It's mandatory to assign a value to constant variables
            <br>
            - Value is constant at compile time.
            <br>
            - We cannot change the value of a const variable throughout the entire program.
            <br>
            readonly:
            <br>
	        - We can change during runtime or we can assign it at run time but only through the non-static constructor.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            - Polymorphism means many forms.
            <br>
            - Two Types
            <br>
            a) Compile time polymorphism also know as Overloading
            <br>
            b) Run time polymorphism also know as Overriding
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>late binding and early binding</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            Compile Time Polymorphism  also known as Early Binding or Overloading
            <br>
            Run Time Polymorphism is also known as Late Binding or Overriding
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>overloading</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            same method but different no. of arguments or type of arguments
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ques">
        <h1>overriding</h1>
        <div class="ans">
            same method and same arguments. Methods in base class with virtual/abstract keywords can be overridden from derived class.
